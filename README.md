# Movie store web application in Clojure
Welcome to the documentation for our movie store built using Clojure! In this documentation, we will cover the various features of our movie store and how to use them.
The goal of this project is to make web application with CRUD operations.

The application uses Mustache logic-less templates for html pages, Clostache is Mustache for Clojure. Ring is used as a basic for this web application. It uses Compojure as routing library for Ring.
Application should allow a user to create a new actor, update, delete, and read all the actors from database. It should also allow for creation of a new producer and cinema, update, delete and read all producers and cinemas from database. It also this web application should read all movies from database.
In this app we have statistic number data for movies, actors, producers and cinemas, also we have average price for all movies.

## User demo introduction

In this part i'm show you quick overview of this website.
<br>

This is the look of homepage card
[homepage1](homepage1.png),
[homepage2](homepage2.png),
[homepage3](homepage3.png), first here we have a scrolling panel, after it is a section opening this year and those are the movies that will be available this year, and finally we have a section subscribe to get newsletter where you can enter your email address, below it you can click and visit my GitHub account.<br>

The look of movies card is here
[movie](movies.png), in section available movies we have a scrolling panel that can be list on both side and here we read movies from our database, also exist option add to cart, when we pass the thought over a certain film, the information about it is printed as you can see in the picture [movie1](movies1.png).
Next two section is the same like homepage, subscribe and GitHub account.

Next three card are very similar. Right here is the look of that three card [actors](actor.png), [producers](producer.png), [cinemas](cinema.png). On card actors we have all actors from our database, in section "actions" we have two button `Edit` and `Delete` for update the existing one and deletiting it, below that has button add actor where we could insert new actor.
When we click the `Edit` button it redirects us to the [update](actoru.png) page and when you click the `Add` button, we get a [form](form.png) for adding a new actor.
On card producers we have all producers from our database, the "actions" section is the same as on the actor page. Button `Edit` redirects us to [update](produceru.png) producer page and button `Add Producer` we get a [form](form.png) for adding new producer.
On card cinemas we have all cinemas from our database, the "actions" section is the same as on the actor page. Button `Edit` redirects us to [update](cinemau.png) cinema page and button `Add Cinema` we get a [form](form.png) for adding new cinema.

## Why we need this tool?
Firstly, access to a wide range of movies. A movie store can provide you with access to a large library of movies, including both new releases and classic films. This can be particularly useful if you enjoy watching movies and want to have a lot of options to choose from.

Some people prefer to own physical copies of movies on DVD or Blu-ray.
Visit web to a movie store can be a fun and nostalgic experience, especially for those who grew up in the era of VHS tapes and video rental stores.

Overall, a movie store can be a great resource for anyone who loves movies and wants to have access to a wide range of titles. A good movie store can provide you with convenience, quality, and a great selection of films to choose from.




## Prerequisites

You will need <a href="https://leiningen.org">Leiningen</a> installed.

## Usage

To start the application, open the terminal and run: `lein run`.<br>
Also you need to import `database.sql` file.

## Description
I hope you enjoy using our movie store web app and that it helps you find your next favorite movie!

This project was developed for the course "Tools and Methods of Artificial Intelligence" at Master studies at Faculty of Organizational Sciences University of Belgrade.

That would be it. I hope you'll like it. However this is my first Clojure project.

## Testing
[Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje) library is a test framework for Clojure.

## Detect errors
[Clj-kondo](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo) is a static analyzer and linter for Clojure code, without the need of a running REPL. It informs you about potential errors while you are typing.
To start the clj-kondo, open the terminal and run: `lein clj-kondo`.
## Conclusion
Building a movie store in Clojure can offer several advantages, including high concurrency, functional programming, scalability, interoperability, a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools, and a simple syntax.
Clojure's focus on immutability, pure functions, and concurrency can help simplify the design and implementation of the movie store, while its ability to scale easily and interoperate with other technologies can help the application grow with your business.
Whether you are building a small movie rental service or a large-scale streaming platform, Clojure can provide a solid foundation for your application, enabling you to offer a user-friendly interface for customers and a powerful set of tools for developers.

[8] https://github.com/blueberry/clojure-web-crud I took this project as a model for my project, the very organization of the project. In this project, I saw how "Mustache" and database connection work, so I used it in my project, too. I implemented other functionalities based on what we did at the University.
